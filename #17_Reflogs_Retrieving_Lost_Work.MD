- ``git reflog`` command is useful for recovering from mistakes in Git.
- This command is helpful in situations like:
    - Losing a commit
    - Performing a rebase that shouldn't have been done
    - Undoing something seemingly undoable
- It's not crucial to memorize the specific command as you can find it online (e.g., Stack Overflow) when needed.

**Important (but not critical)**:
- ``git reflog`` can be used for rescuing lost commits and undoing rebases.
