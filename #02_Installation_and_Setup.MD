### <a name="cmd">Git: Command line & GUIs</a>

#### Two ways to interact with Git:
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Powerful, efficient, but less user-friendly.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Easier to learn, more visual, but can be less flexible.

#### Pros of CLI:
- Faster for experienced users.
- More powerful and feature-rich.
- Consistent across different platforms.
- Documentation and resources are geared towards CLI.

#### Cons of CLI:
Steeper learning curve.
Less user-friendly interface.

#### Pros of GUI:
- Lower barrier to entry.
- More intuitive and visual.
- Can be a better fit for some users.

#### Cons of GUI:
- May not fully explain what's happening behind the scenes.
- Can lead to dependence on specific software.
- Features and interfaces can vary between different GUIs.

#### Windows

**Key Points of Installing Git on Windows**:
- Windows installation is trickier than Mac due to Git being designed for Unix.
- Download and install Git Bash, which emulates a Unix experience.
- Consider switching the default text editor from Vim to a more user-friendly option like VS Code.
- Git installer offers options for customizing settings like branch name and line endings (not covered in detail in this summary).
- Verify successful installation by running ``git --version`` in the Git Bash terminal.
- Git Bash is the primary interface for using Git on Windows.
