### <a name="public-private">Github Repo Visibility: Public Vs. Private</a>

**Understanding Visibility**:

- Repositories on GitHub can be public or private.
- **Public**: Anyone on the internet can view the code, but cannot modify it without permission.
- **Private**: Only the owner and collaborators explicitly granted access can view and modify the code.

**Creating a Repository**:
1. Go to your account on GitHub.
2. Click "New repository."
3. Enter a name for your repository.
4. Choose **Public** or **Private** under "Visibility."

**Changing Visibility**:
1. Go to the repository settings.
2. Scroll down to the "Danger Zone" section.
3. Click "Change repository visibility."
4. Enter the repository name to confirm.
5. Type your password.

### <a name="readme">What are READMEs?</a>

- A **README** file is a crucial file in a GitHub repository.
- It explains the purpose, usage, and other important information about your project.
- It is displayed automatically by GitHub if placed in the **root** of your repository.
- It is typically written in **markdown (.md)** format, which allows for easy formatting of text.

**Important to know (not code)**:

- While not mandatory, a good README should include:
    - Project description and purpose
    - Installation and usage instructions
    - Contribution guidelines (if applicable)
    - Contact information for support
- READMEs are the first impression for visitors to your project, so make them informative and clear.

#### What is it?
- A tool that converts plain text to HTML.
- Commonly used on GitHub for READMEs and other purposes.

#### - **Basic Syntax:
- **Headings**: Use hash symbols (#) before the text (e.g., # This is a Heading 1)
- **Bold**: Use two asterisks (*) around the text (e.g., **bold text**)
- **Italic**: Use one asterisk (*) or underscore (_) around the text (e.g., italic text or italic text)
- **Strikethrough**: Use two tildes (~) around the text (e.g., ~~strikethrough text~~)
- **Blockquotes**: Use a greater than sign (>) at the beginning of each line.
- **Lists**: Use asterisks (*), plus signs (+), or hyphens (-) for unordered lists. Use numbers for ordered lists.
- **Code**: Use single backticks () around inline code. Use three backticks () above and below for code blocks. Optionally, specify the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., javascript).
- **Links**: Enclose the link text in square brackets ([ ]) and follow it with the URL in parentheses (()).
- **Images**: Use an exclamation point (!) followed by the image URL in square brackets ([ ]) and alt text in parentheses (()).
