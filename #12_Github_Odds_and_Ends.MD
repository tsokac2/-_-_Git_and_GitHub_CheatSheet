**Understanding Visibility**:

- Repositories on GitHub can be public or private.
- **Public**: Anyone on the internet can view the code, but cannot modify it without permission.
- **Private**: Only the owner and collaborators explicitly granted access can view and modify the code.

**Creating a Repository**:
1. Go to your account on GitHub.
2. Click "New repository."
3. Enter a name for your repository.
4. Choose **Public** or **Private** under "Visibility."

**Changing Visibility**:

2. Scroll down to the "Danger Zone" section.
3. Click "Change repository visibility."

### <a name="readme">What are READMEs?</a>

- A **README** file is a crucial file in a GitHub repository.
- It explains the purpose, usage, and other important information about your project.
- It is displayed automatically by GitHub if placed in the **root** of your repository.
- It is typically written in **markdown (.md)** format, which allows for easy formatting of text.

**Important to know (not code)**:

- While not mandatory, a good README should include:
    - Project description and purpose
    - Installation and usage instructions
    - Contribution guidelines (if applicable)
    - Contact information for support
- READMEs are the first impression for visitors to your project, so make them informative and clear.
