- Git uses commit hashes to uniquely identify each commit. (These look like long strings of letters and numbers.)
- Each commit references one or more parent commits that came before it.
Branches are separate timelines for your project. They allow you to work on different things in isolation.
- You can create a new branch using the ``git branch`` command (e.g., ``git branch new-color-scheme``).
- You can switch between branches using the ``git checkout`` command (e.g., ``git checkout bug-fix``).
- Merging branches allows you to combine changes from one branch into another branch. (This will be covered in a future video.)
