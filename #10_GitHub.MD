#### git clone: Cloning Non-Github Repos

**Command**: ``git clone``
- This command is used to create a copy (clone) of an existing Git repository.
- It can be used with repositories hosted on various platforms, not just GitHub.

**Permissions**:
- Public repositories on platforms like GitHub can be freely cloned by anyone.
- Cloning a private repository requires permission from the owner.

**Important**:
- Cloning a repository allows you to work with the code locally, but does not grant permission to push changes back to the original repository without following the proper contribution workflow.
