![Git Tages]()


- Tags are used to mark specific commits (versions) in your Git repository history.
- You can name them anything but typically used for version releases (e.g., v3.1.0.0).
- Tags are like bookmarks pointing to a specific commit unlike branch references which change as you add commits.

**Important command**:

- ``git tag``: This command is used to create, list, delete or manipulate tags.

**There are two types of tags**:

1. **Lightweight tags**:
    - Simpler tags containing just a name and reference to a commit.

2. **Annotated tags** (preferred):
    - Include additional information like tag message, author details and date.
